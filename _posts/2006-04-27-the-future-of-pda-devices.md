> <span style="font-weight: bold;">PDA Only Devices Dying A Slow Death</span>  
> According to market intelligence firm IDC, sales of PDA devices without phone capabilities are down 9 straight quarters in a row. Obviously, with smartphones having more and more PDA functionality due to faster chips and better software, people donâ€™t feel the need to carry around both a cellphone and a PDA.

I both agree and disagree. I think the PDA and SmartPhone companies have it wrong.  
They should be selling <span style="font-style: italic;">kits. </span>Why does everything have to be one piece?

Imagine a PDA and a Phone which are super integrated with one another over BlueTooth or even something more powerful but proprietary. Both components would be super streamlined- totally complimentary- ie. if there is gps in one the other won&#8217;t have it, if there is a camera in one the other won&#8217;t have it.

The PDA component does everything a PDA should. It also has all the added functionality of cellular communications because it is integrated with your Cellphone. The Cellphone component is just a cellphone. It get&#8217;s it&#8217;s contacts seemlessly from the PDA component. No need for calendaring, games, etc.- that all goes on the PDA. On the other hand- the PDA&#8217;s calendar can use the cellphone for audible alerts, vibrating alerts, etc. instead of relying on the usually unimpressive speakers they put in PDAs. I&#8217;m not sure where you would put the camera ðŸ˜‰

The first company to start selling such a kit will win the war in my opinion.
