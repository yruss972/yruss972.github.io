[Selenium IDE](http://openqa.org/selenium-ide/) is a QA tool for testing web applications.

With the IDE extension for Firefox, you can easily create automatic tests for your websites.

IBM has already picked up on this and the project seems very active (it jumped from v0.7 to v0.8 in front of my own eyes).
