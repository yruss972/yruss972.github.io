Google Analytics has been showing me weird numbers since the beginning of February. While it is completely possible that these numbers are correct, it is also hard for me to believe.

[<img src="http://www.yonahruss.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/AnalyticsStats.gif" alt="Since February Analytics shows the same number of visitors each day" title="AnalyticsStats" width="300" height="193" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-249" />](http://www.yonahruss.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/AnalyticsStats.gif)Usually, the traffic looks like a rough bell will low traffic on the weekends.

The number of visitors each day is almost exactly the same (103,102,103,104) which has never been the case for this site.
