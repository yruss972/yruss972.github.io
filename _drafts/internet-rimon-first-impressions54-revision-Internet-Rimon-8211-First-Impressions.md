Last night I came home to a house without Internet. It is my fault really- I hadn&#8217;t found time to switch to a new provider and my old job finally canceled the account they had given me.  
Most of the reason I hadn&#8217;t decided on a new provider was because I was debating switching to the new Israeli ISP &#8211; Internet Rimon.

On one hand they provide &#8220;kosher internet&#8221; and it seems the religious thing to do.  
On the other hand, I have been responsible for providing filtered internet solutions before and I was worried that the filtering would make it impossible for me to work from home.

Now before I say more, I&#8217;m signed up to the most basic package which is only supposed to filter out pornography and violence. It is taking the &#8220;blacklist&#8221; approach which will always have some cracks. I would assume that the more protected packages work differently and possibly &#8220;better&#8221;.

As the package is, it looks to me like it will filter out casual contact with unwanted content. It may even stop an undetermined teenager. <span style="font-weight: bold;">It has no chance of defeating someone mildly determined. I don&#8217;t see much in the way of special technology that was all hyped up in the media.</span>

In short, I bypassed the filtering at least two ways in 20 minutes using nothing but freeware and a browser. If you think Internet Rimon is going to protect you kids from the Internet, don&#8217;t rely on the basic package. I&#8217;m not sure the stricter packages are better but I can tell you that the basic package will only stop casual browsing from landing on something immodest.
