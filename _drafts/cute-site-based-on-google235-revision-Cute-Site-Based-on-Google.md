I just ran into an interesting site <a href="http://goosh.org" rel="nofollow">goosh.org</a>. Goosh = GOOgle SHell &#8211; basically the guy has built a CLI or shell interface to google services.  
Strangely enough, it gives you a CLI inside your web browser which might be an oxymoron but it&#8217;s cute anyway.  
It apparently has the ability to access your accounts if you login but I wouldn&#8217;t trust my identity to it so be careful.
