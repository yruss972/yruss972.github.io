I&#8217;ve been working with Unix for a fairly long time now- about 13 years.

I&#8217;ll admit that I started with Linux and thought it was light years ahead of SunOS 4.x running on those old SPARC machines- I mean who had heard of SPARC processors? I remember my boss trying to explain to me that even an older SPARC processor was more powerful than a newer Intel Pentium processor. I didn&#8217;t really believe him. In time, I convinced them to get rid of most of their SPARC/Solaris in favor of the hip, free, and cheap Intel/Linux combination.

Now I see that I couldn&#8217;t have been more wrong. I realize that SunOS 4.x probably still has features which I don&#8217;t know how to use properly. When I look at Solaris 10, ZFS, Zones, LDOMS, DTrace, etc. I not really sure you could pay me to work with Linux (that would be soo depressing). That isn&#8217;t even mentioning the SPARC hardware it runs on- Can any Intel server compare to a T5140???

That&#8217;s why the current situation with Sun absolutely SUCKS (pardon my french)! I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of admins out there who feel the same way. If this Oracle deal doesn&#8217;t go through and Sun disappears because of it, it will be our loss. We&#8217;ll be stuck with mediocre operating systems and commodity hardware and I really hope it doesn&#8217;t happen.

That said, I&#8217;d like to say thanks to all the people at Sun who are still turning out crazy cool technologies despite the problems.
