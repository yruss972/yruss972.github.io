Recently this issue came up on the linux-il mailing list. Apparently one of the bigger Israeli ISPs started enforcing a bandwidth cap clause in their Terms of Service after they realized that their lines were overloaded. A couple people pulled out the following statistic:

> P2P still represented 60% of Internet traffic at the end of 2004- http://www.cachelogic.com/research/2005_slide07.php

I&#8217;ve seen this and similar statistics before but why people are surprised by it, I never understand. The fact is meaningless but, for some reason, everyone thinks it proves that the ISPs are right.

The truth is that even if 95% of the Internet users only used the Internet for email, P2P could still theoretically take up 60% of the bandwidth because it is inheirintly a very high bandwidth application.

Let&#8217;s assume for the sake of arguement that there are 100 users on the Internet.

  * 25 of the users are using only P2P and 75 of the users are using only Email. 
  * All users have a 1M connection.
  * The P2P users download 24/7 giving them 24M bandwidth usage per day.

Even if each email user downloads 5.33M of email each day, the P2P users still used 60% of the bandwidth.

<pre>5.33*75=400<br />24*25=600<br />------------<br />Total: 1000<br /></pre>

In reality P2P users will probably have higher speed connections than Email users which will give them an even more disproportionate share of the bandwidth.

Once we&#8217;ve decided that P2P will always have a huge share of the bandwidth regardless of what percentage of people are actually using it, the real questions become:

  1. Maybe P2P is accounts for 60% of what&#8217;s being used, but how much isn&#8217;t being used?
  2. Isn&#8217;t this fact, that some people are using more bandwidth than others, the same reason that ISPs can overbook their lines and make a profit?
  3. If an ISP does a crummy job of planning their &#8220;overbooking&#8221; should the customers pay the price?

Imagine if an ISP would secretly give every new customer 5M lines for a month and a half- then all of a sudden the speed drops to 1.5M.

Joe schmoe doesn&#8217;t know what&#8217;s hit him and when he calls customer service, the rep tells him &#8220;Oh I&#8217;m sorry &#8211; we accidentally gave you a 5M line and only just corrected the mistake but don&#8217;t worry we won&#8217;t charge  
you for it- BTW are you interested in our new special on 5M lines?&#8221;

It&#8217;s the same here- for months/years they didn&#8217;t say anything. Now when people are used to it- they come and ask for money. It is their own fault that they overbook the lines- they should deal with it and if they want to limit new customers- gei gezunt.

I have to say that I&#8217;m pretty sure I fall into the category of the Email users and I don&#8217;t use the ISP in question but if I were in the place of their newly &#8220;capped&#8221; customers, I would switch to another ISP the same day.
