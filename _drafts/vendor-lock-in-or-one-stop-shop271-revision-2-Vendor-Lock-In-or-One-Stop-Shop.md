I was recently discussing load balancers with someone. I said I was much happier with F5 than I was with Cisco and he countered that although he preferred F5 head to head, going with Cisco for all the network was better for them in the long run.

The situation with storage is similar. EMC makes a great SAN but a pretty bad NAS. Is it worth getting EMC&#8221;s NAS for the One Stop Shop factor?

Since Oracle&#8217;s acquisition of Sun, I&#8217;ve been looking forward to the success of their &#8220;One Stop Shop&#8221; philosophy. Successfully bringing all their offerings under one roof promises better and faster support all around.

Unfortunately, it has been almost a year and Oracle is still not sure how they are to unify the customer support systems. New support contracts don&#8217;t work in either system.Â  To make things a little less clear, Oracle recently announced that everything will be migrated to &#8220;My Oracle Support&#8221; but they don&#8217;t know when- very reassuring.

A simple pattern emerges. One Stop Shop is a dream for IT people. Support is hard enough to get when you&#8217;ve isolated a problem to a specific vendor. It is even harder when your problems are between two vendors and each points the finger at the other.

When does the One Stop Shop strategy become a rationalization for Vendor Lock-In? It is a delicate balance around how much better your IT could be with Best of Breed vs. how much worse they will be integrating all the different pieces of the puzzle.

Regarding Cisco vs. F5, I&#8217;m also pretty happy letting Cisco handle everything Layer 3 and under and I don&#8217;t worry too much about the integration. I&#8217;m also optimistic regarding Sun and Oracle. I think they&#8217;ll have the wrinkles ironed out by the second half of 2011. If they don&#8217;t, it will be a serious let down.
